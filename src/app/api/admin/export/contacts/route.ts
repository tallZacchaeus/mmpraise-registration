/**
 * The contact list: who to write to, and what they agreed to.
 *
 * The full applicant export answers "tell me everything about these people".
 * This answers the narrower question an administrator actually has when
 * sending a follow-up — who is in this segment, what address reaches them, and
 * am I entitled to use it. Pasting a 24-column sheet of church details,
 * occupations and emergency contacts into a mail tool to get at the email
 * column spreads personal data further than the job needs.
 *
 * **On consent.** `consentCommunication` is compulsory to submit a
 * participation (`z.literal(true)`) and its wording is *registration and
 * volunteer-related communication*. It is therefore evidence of agreement to
 * service email, and it is NOT a marketing opt-in: nobody was offered the
 * choice to decline, so it cannot identify who would have. The columns carry
 * the consent and the date it was taken so the basis travels with the
 * addresses rather than being assumed by whoever opens the file. A genuine
 * marketing segment needs a separate optional opt-in, which does not exist yet.
 *
 * Same filters, same scope and the same department restriction as the list, so
 * this can never reach further than the administrator can already see.
