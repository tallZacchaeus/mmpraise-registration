 * Human wording for the migration enums.

 * they can poll progress, and importing the service module there would pull the
 * database client into the browser bundle.
 *
 * Every label is written for someone who did not design the schema. "COMPLETED_
 * WITH_WARNINGS" is accurate and unreadable; "Finished with problems" is what
 * an administrator needs to see at a glance in a list of twenty batches.
